### Main idea
This is a game written in rust and bevy.
The idea for it is for it to be a rouglike arena shooter.
Player would be a wizard that would use amulets to cast custom spells.
There would be different types of spells that can chain and have different interactions with eachother.

### Other ideas
 - levels could be selected like in slay the spire - they would have different arenas like open fileds or narrow corridors. This could impact the choice for spells.
